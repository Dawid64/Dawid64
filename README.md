<h2 align="center"> Hi, I'm Dawid </h2>

- Studying **Artificial Intelligence**
- Working as **Quantum Software Developer**
- Passionate about **AutoML**

<h2 align="center"> 🚀 About Me 🚀 </h2>

- 🐍 **Python Developer**: I love Python, for it's flexibility and possibilities, even if it's done in weird way sometimes. I believe there is nothing that you cannot do in one line, if you disagree, try me :D
- 🌟 **ML Enthusiast**: Finding some interesting pattern's or just solving problems without overthinking for heuristics. Machine Learning is so fun that automating it with AutoML is truly moral dilemma.
- 🎨 **Data Visualization + Explainability**: Yea, I just think that it's more important to understand the problem, and understand why something is happening than just getting the right answer.

🔧 **[Turbo-ML](https://github.com/Tole-k/Turbo-ML)**
</h3>

- **Role**: Author  
- **Description**: Turbo-ML's goal is to make AutoML as quick as possible, so there will be no more reason not to use it. If it will take just few seconds, to get you much better prediction that some basic intuition or baseline model!
- **Current Status**: We are currently preparing a paper about our work, that hopefully you may found soon

💡 **[Decorify](https://github.com/Dawid64/decorify)**

</h3>

- **Role**: Author  
- **Description**: Decorify is a Python library that provides a collection of decorators to simplify coding routine tasks that usually take a bit to think how to make them such as:
  - Timing a function
  - Setting time limit for function duration
  - Typehints validation
- **Current Status**: The library is in version 0.1.1, but soon will be updated to 0.1.2 version

🔮 **[TorchBoard](https://github.com/Dawid64/Torch-Board)**

</h3>

- **Role**: Author  
- **Description**: TorchBoard is a dashboard application adding new interactive experience for learning process of pytorch models, providing user with such functionalities, as changing hyperparameters during the training process, with minimalistic integration to current project.
- **Current Status**: Actively developing new features and improving existing ones, library available on PyPI.

<h2 align="center"> 🌟 What I Believe In 🌟 </h2>

> The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

```py
import this
```

The simpler is the code the better it is.
Nesting is unnecessary, but it's better than writing 5x lines of code. Typehints may describe much more than large docstring.
Docstring describes much more than many comments. Everything can be explained as it is simple, and everything can be described as it would be complex.
